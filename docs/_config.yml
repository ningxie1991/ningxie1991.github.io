user_description: I am an experienced software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my five years in the FinTech industry, I have honed my collaboration skills, web application development practices and analytical thinking in a dynamic global working environment. Currently I am pursuing a master's degree in People-Oriented Computing at the University of Zurich with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. My thesis topic is on quantifying the trustworthiness level of federated machine learning models. I look forward to apply my past industry experience and improved knowledge from my masterâ€™s studies in the next professional role within the digital innovation industry.
